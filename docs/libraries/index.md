# Libraries

Cape Privacy provides libraries that allow you to:

* Train models in collaboration with other entities without revealing the contents of your datasets.
* Write data security policies in YAML format.
* Create scripts that apply your policies to your data.
* Use Cape Privacy's standard data transformations. <!-- TODO: coming soon: can also write your own -->
