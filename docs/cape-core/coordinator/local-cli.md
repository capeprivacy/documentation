# Install and run Cape Coordinator using the Cape CLI

This document describes how to install and run Cape Coordinator on your local machine, using the Cape CLI. This setup allows you to try out Cape Coordinator without going through the full [Kubernetes deployment process](/cape-core/coordinator/kubernetes/).

## Set up PostgreSQL for Cape

The following instructions include how to install PostgreSQL with a package manager for Linux and macOS, and using a GUI installer for Windows. For alternative PostgreSQL installation methods, refer to the [PostgreSQL downloads page](https://www.postgresql.org/download/). Postgresql version 11.0+ is required.

All Windows instructions assume you are using PowerShell.

=== "Linux"
    ```shell
    # Install PostgreSQL
    # Refer to the guidance for your distribution: https://www.postgresql.org/download/

    # Create a Cape user
    createuser --createdb cape

    # Create a Cape database
    createdb -U cape cape
    ```

=== "MacOS"
    ```shell
    # Install Postgres
    # Requires Homebrew: https://brew.sh/
    brew install postgres

    # Create a Cape user
    createuser --createdb cape

    # Create a Cape database
    createdb -U cape cape
    ```

=== "Windows (PowerShell)"
    We recommend using the GUI installer for PostgreSQL on Windows. There is also a [Chocolatey package](https://chocolatey.org/packages/postgresql) available.

    1. Download the installer from [PostgreSQL Windows installers](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/).
    2. Run the installer. Accept the default settings at each stage. It will prompt you to set a password for the postgres user. Make a note of this password.
    3. Do not launch StackBuilder when the installation finishes.
    4. Create a user. When prompted, enter the postgres user password that you created during installation.
    ```shell
    # Create a user named cape.
    createuser -U postgres --createdb --pwprompt cape
    ```
    5. Create a database. When prompted, enter the user password you created in the previous step.
    ```shell
    # Create a database.
    createdb -U cape cape
    ```


## Download and set up Cape Coordinator

=== "Linux"
    ```shell
    # Download the Cape binary
    curl -O https://github.com/capeprivacy/cape/releases/download/v0.0.1/cape_0.0.1_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
    tar xf cape_0.0.1_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
    chmod +x cape

    # Download and extract the database schema files
    curl -O https://github.com/capeprivacy/cape/releases/download/v0.0.1/capeprivacy-cape-postgres-v0.0.1.zip
    unzip capeprivacy-cape-postgres-v0.0.1.zip

    # Create the database schema. Replace `<PASSWORD>` with your postgres user password.
    export CAPE_DB_URL=postgres://postgres:<PASSWORD>@localhost:5432/cape
    ./cape update coordinator/migrations
    
    #TODO: we should probably point people to add the cape to their path rather than keep typing ./cape ...?

    # Configure the Cape Coordinator server component
    ./cape coordinator configure
    ```

    Cape asks you for information about your installation. For this example, use port 8080.

    When this process completes, it creates a file called `config.yaml`.

    Set user details, then start the coordinator. Make a note of the values you set for each field.

    ```shell
    CAPE_USER_NAME=<USERNAME>
    CAPE_USER_EMAIL=<EMAIL>
    # The password must be eight characters minimum
    CAPE_USER_PASSWORD=<PASSWORD>
    # Start the coordinator
    ./cape coordinator start --file config.yaml
    ```

=== "MacOS"
    ```shell
    # Download the Cape binary
    curl -O https://github.com/capeprivacy/cape/releases/download/v0.0.1/cape_0.0.1_Darwin_x86_64.tar.gz
    tar xf cape_0.0.1_Darwin_x86_64.tar.gz
    chmod +x cape

    # Download and extract the database schema files
    curl -O https://github.com/capeprivacy/cape/releases/download/v0.0.1/capeprivacy-cape-postgres-v0.0.1.zip
    unzip capeprivacy-cape-postgres-v0.0.1.zip

    # Create the database schema. Replace `<PASSWORD>` with your postgres user password.
    export CAPE_DB_URL=postgres://postgres:<PASSWORD>@localhost:5432/cape
    ./cape update coordinator/migrations

    # Configure the Cape Coordinator server component
    ./cape coordinator configure
    ```

    Cape asks you for information about your installation. For this example, use port 8080.

    #TODO: we should probably point people to add the cape to their path rather than keep typing ./cape ...?

    When this process completes, it creates a file called `config.yaml`.

    Set user details, then start the coordinator. Make a note of the values you set for each field.

    ```shell
    CAPE_USER_NAME=<USERNAME>
    CAPE_USER_EMAIL=<EMAIL>
    # The password must be eight characters minimum
    CAPE_USER_PASSWORD=<PASSWORD>
    # Start the coordinator
    ./cape coordinator start --file config.yaml
    ```

=== "Windows (PowerShell)"
    1. Download the Windows installer `.zip` from [Cape releases](https://github.com/capeprivacy/cape/releases).
    2. Unzip the installer.
    3. Copy the unzipped directory to a location of your choice.
    4. Add the directory to your `PATH`. Refer to [Add to Windows PATH environment variable](https://helpdeskgeek.com/windows-10/add-windows-path-environment-variable/) for help.
    5. If you are still using the same PowerShell window as in the previous section, run `refreshenv` to load the updated `PATH`.
    5. Download the database schema files: [capeprivacy-cape-postgres-v0.0.1.zip](https://github.com/capeprivacy/cape/releases/download/v0.0.1/capeprivacy-cape-postgres-v0.0.1.zip)
    6. Unzip the files.
    7. Run the following command to set up the database. Replace `<PASSWORD>` with the password you created when installing PostgreSQL.
    ```shell
    $env:CAPE_DB_URL='postgres://postgres:<PASSSWORD>@localhost:5432/cape'
    cape update coordinator\migrations

    # Configure the Cape Coordinator server component
    cape coordinator configure
    ```

    Cape asks you for information about your installation. For this example, use port 8080.

    When this process completes, it creates a file called `config.yaml`.

    Set user details, then start the coordinator. Make a note of the values you set for each field.

    ```shell
    $env:CAPE_USER_NAME='<USERNAME>'
    $env:CAPE_USER_EMAIL='<EMAIL>'
    # The password must be eight characters minimum
    $env:CAPE_USER_PASSWORD='<PASSWORD>'
    # Start the coordinator
    cape coordinator start --file config.yaml
    ```

## Configure the CLI and log in to Cape

Open a new terminal, and run the following commands:

```shell
# Configure the Cape CLI
cape config clusters add local http://localhost:8080
cape config clusters use local
# Log in to Cape
cape login
```

At this point you can begin exploring Cape:

```shell
cape projects list
```
