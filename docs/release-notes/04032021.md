## Import pycape; Run encrypted learning

pycape allows you to run encrypted learning jobs in a few lines of Python. To review how the process works for an encrypted linear regression job, review [Cape's tutorial on running an encrypted Linear Regression job](../libraries/pycape/tutorials/submit_linear_regression_job/).

Refer to the [full pycape documentation](../libraries/pycape) for more information.
