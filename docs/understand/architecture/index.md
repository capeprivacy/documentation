# Cape Privacy architecture

Cape Privacy's architecture is a collection of services and libraries that work with each other and your own data management tooling.

## Components

Cape Privacy currently offers three components:

* The Cape UI, from which you can set up data-science projects to collaborate on with other organizations.
* The Python libary [pycape](/libraries/pycape/). With **pycape** you can interact with your Cape projects, view and update details of your project, and manipulate and upload your datasets to Cape. 
* [Cape Python](/libraries/cape-python/). The first Cape Privacy library to be released, providing Python-based data transformations for Pandas and Apache Spark (PySpark).


## Roadmap

More services and libraries are coming soon. Refer to the [roadmap](/understand/roadmap/) for more information.
