# Cape Privacy architecture

Cape Privacy's architecture is a collection of services and libraries that work with each other and your own data management tooling.

## Components

Cape Privacy currently offers three components:

* The Cape Cloud Service (referred to as "Cape"), where you can set up data-science projects to collaborate on with other organizations. This service also includes the Cape broker, allowing you to easily and securely work across different clouds.
* [Cape Workers](/understand/cape-workers/), which are run by your organization to orchestrate and run encrypted learning jobs.
* The Python libary [pycape](/libraries/pycape/). With **pycape** you can interact with your Cape projects, view and update details of your project, and manipulate and upload your datasets to Cape. 


## Roadmap

More services and libraries are coming soon. Refer to the [roadmap](/understand/roadmap/) for more information.

## Archived Projects

* [Cape Python](/libraries/cape-python/). The first Cape Privacy library to be released, providing Python-based data transformations for Pandas and Apache Spark (PySpark). This project is now archived and may later be removed.
