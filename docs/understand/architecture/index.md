# Cape Privacy architecture

Cape Privacy's architecture is a collection of services and libraries that work with each other and your own data management tooling.

## Components

Cape Privacy currently offers three components:

* [Cape Coordinator](/cape-core/coordinator/). This provides policy management, and can integrate with Cape Privacy's libraries.
* [Cape Python](/libraries/cape-python/). The first Cape Privacy library to be released, providing Python-based data transformations for Pandas and Apache Spark (PySpark).
* The [command line interface](/cape-core/cli/). A CLI to allow users to interact with Cape Coordinator.


## Roadmap

More services and libraries are coming soon. Refer to the [roadmap](/understand/roadmap/) for more information.
