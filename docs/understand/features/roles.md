# Roles

In Cape, there are five roles which have different permissions and responsibilities for using the Cape Cloud service. Each Cape user can be assigned a role when they join an organization. Currently, Cape only supports one role per user.

!!! note
    Cape refers to all users associated with a project as "contributors" to that project, and manages project users with organizational roles they are assigned. For example, if a user has a data scientist role and is assigned to a project, they now can perform actions associated with that role on that project.
