# Projects

Projects are the building block for encrypted learning within Cape. 

In the real world, most machine learning experiments are run for a specific use case with a set amount of data. On Cape, organizations can work together on a project to build a model using encrypted data that is spread within an organization or across organizations and clouds. Cape Project's allow your organization to register data for usage, create, approve and run encrypted learning jobs and manage the variety of data science tasks necessary for keeping your experiment successful.
