# CONTRIBUTING

Contributions are more than welcome and we're always looking for ideas!

This document will help you:

* [Run the docs locally](#run-the-docs-locally), allowing you to preview your work.
* [Contribute to the docs](#contribute-to-the-docs).
* [Understand the docs tooling](#understand-the-docs-tooling).


## Run the docs locally

Prerequisites:

* git
* Python 64bit (currently using 3.7 due to [Netlify limitations](https://github.com/netlify/build-image/blob/xenial/included_software.md)).
* pip
* venv
* [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

1. Clone this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/capeprivacy/documentation.git
```

2. In the `documentation` directory, create a virtual environment with [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#module-venv):

```
python -m venv ./venv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment. The exact command depends on your shell:

```
# Powershell
./venv/Scripts/activate.ps1

# Bash
. venv/Scripts/activate
```

4. Install the [Material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material), [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and [Pydoc-markdown](https://github.com/NiklasRosenstein/pydoc-markdown):

```
make boostrap
```

If you would like to update the reference documentation for a Cape library, run:

```
make dsdocs
```

5. To view the docs locally:

```
mkdocs serve
```

You can now view the docs at `localhost:8080`. 

Note that this does not autogenerate the latest code documentation. Refer to [Understand the docs tooling](#understand-the-docs-tooling) for detailed information on the documentation setup.


## Contribute to the docs

This section describes how to edit the handwritten docs website content.

The main branch is live. All work should happen on another branch.

To publish the latest updates to the documentation run:
```
make build
```

This will create a bundled static site in the `/site` directory. Check this directory in to source control.

### Submitting a pull request

To contribute, [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) Cape Python, commit your changes, and [open a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

While you may be asked to make changes to your submission during the review process, we will work with you on this and suggest changes. Consider giving us [push rights to your branch](https://help.github.com/articles/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork/) so we can potentially also help via commits.

### Style and tone

Refer to the [Writing style and tone](https://github.com/capeprivacy/documentation/wiki/Writing-style-and-tone) page in our wiki.

## Understand the docs tooling
