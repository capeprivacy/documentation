# Create a user

You must add users to Cape, so that they can interact with projects and policy files through the Cape CLI.

To add a user, you must have the global `admin` role. Refer to [user roles](/understand/user-roles/) for more information.

Create a new user, with `user` level access.

When prompted, enter their name. Cape automatically generates a password.
```shell
cape users create <USER_EMAIL>
```
