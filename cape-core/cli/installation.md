#  Cape CLI installation

Binaries are available for Windows 10, Linux, and macOS. [Download here](https://github.com/capeprivacy/cape/releases).

Once downloaded, you can run the binary from anywhere. You don't need to install it into a global location. 

For ease of use, you should ideally place it in a sensible location and add it to your `PATH`. The location depends on on your operating system. For example, on Linux this might be `/usr/local/bin`, while on Windows it might be your `Programs` directory, or `C:\Users\<USERNAME>`. 

If you are unsure how to modify your `PATH`, check out the following guides:
