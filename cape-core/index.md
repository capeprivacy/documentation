# Cape Core

Cape Core is a collection of services and tools that form the foundation of Cape functionality.

Cape Core currently comprises:

* [Cape Coordinator](/cape-core/coordinator/): a service for managing data privacy policies.
* [Cape CLI](/cape-core/cli/): a command line interface to allow users to interact with Cape services.

We will add more services and tools in future releases. Refer to our [roadmap](/understand/roadmap/) for more information.
